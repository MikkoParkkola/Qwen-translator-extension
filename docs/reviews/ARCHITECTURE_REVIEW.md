Architecture Review â€“ PR #388

Scope: CI e2e job, docs, version bump, consolidation script.

Impact
- No changes to runtime architecture or module boundaries.
- CI adds a separate e2e job; does not affect build artifacts.
- Consolidation script is an optional developer tool.

Decisions
- Keep `build-and-test` as the single required context to preserve fast merges.
- Run e2e in a dependent job; artifacts uploaded for diagnostics.

Conclusion: No architectural risks introduced.
