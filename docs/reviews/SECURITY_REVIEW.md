Security Review â€“ PR #388

Scope: CI job additions (Playwright e2e), documentation updates, version bump, branch consolidation script.

Assessment
- Secrets: No new secrets added; gh uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by Actions. No API keys committed.
- Permissions: CI jobs use default permissions; `automerge` job writes PR via `GITHUB_TOKEN` only.
- Data handling: No changes to runtime data paths; no PII added to logs.
- Network: e2e uses local static server (127.0.0.1). No external calls.
- Supply chain: No new dependencies beyond Playwright in dev (already present).

Recommendations
- Keep `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions minimal (content/pull-requests only for automerge).
- Periodically rotate provider keys in storage; never log credentials.

Conclusion: Low risk. No changes required.
