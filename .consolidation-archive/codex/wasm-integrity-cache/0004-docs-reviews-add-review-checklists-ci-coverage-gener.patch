+Architecture Review – PR #388
+
+Scope: CI e2e job, docs, version bump, consolidation script.
+
+Impact
+- No changes to runtime architecture or module boundaries.
+- CI adds a separate e2e job; does not affect build artifacts.
+- Consolidation script is an optional developer tool.
+
+Decisions
+- Keep `build-and-test` as the single required context to preserve fast merges.
+- Run e2e in a dependent job; artifacts uploaded for diagnostics.
+
+Conclusion: No architectural risks introduced.

+Legal Review – PR #388
+
+Scope: CI e2e job, docs, version bump, consolidation script.
+
+Licensing
+- License remains AGPL-3.0-or-later (unchanged).
+- No third-party code added beyond existing dev dependencies.
+
+Privacy/GDPR
+- No collection or processing of personal data added.
+- e2e tests operate on local synthetic fixtures.
+
+Conclusion: Compliant; no legal changes required.

+Performance Review – PR #388
+
+Scope: CI e2e job, docs, version bump, consolidation script.
+
+Findings
+- Runtime performance unchanged; no hot path modifications.
+- CI time marginally increases due to e2e; job runs in parallel and is not required for branch protection.
+
+Actions: None required.

+Security Review – PR #388
+
+Scope: CI job additions (Playwright e2e), documentation updates, version bump, branch consolidation script.
+
+Assessment
+- Secrets: No new secrets added; gh uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by Actions. No API keys committed.
+- Permissions: CI jobs use default permissions; `automerge` job writes PR via `GITHUB_TOKEN` only.
+- Data handling: No changes to runtime data paths; no PII added to logs.
+- Network: e2e uses local static server (127.0.0.1). No external calls.
+- Supply chain: No new dependencies beyond Playwright in dev (already present).
+
+Recommendations
+- Keep `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions minimal (content/pull-requests only for automerge).
+- Periodically rotate provider keys in storage; never log credentials.
+
+Conclusion: Low risk. No changes required.

+UX Review – PR #388
+
+Scope: Documentation updates and CI-only changes.
+
+User-Facing
+- README adds CI badge and a detailed Troubleshooting section.
+- No UI changes to popup or content HUD.
+
+Accessibility
+- Docs use clear headings and concise bullets; no impact to UI semantics.
+
+Conclusion: No UX regressions introduced.
